JAX-RS Procedure Tutorial

  This tutorial demonstrates configuring a JAX-RS end point method as a procedure.

  Adding a JAX-RS end point method as a procedure, allows re-use of existing code. Ideally, over time, the JAX-RS resources are simplified to methods taking advantage of OfficeFloor's {{{https://sagenschneider.blogspot.com/2019/02/inversion-of-coupling-control.html}IoCC}}. However, JAX-RS is supported as procedures to avoid significant rewrites of application code.  This enables taking advantage of OfficeFloor's features with existing JAX-RS code.

*Configuring JAX-RS

  Please see the {{{../JaxRsWarHttpServer/index.html}JAX-RS Tutorial}} regarding configuring JAX-RS resources into WoOF.  The tutorial needs to be followed to also enable JAX-RS end point methods to be configured as procedures.



*Configuring as a Procedure

  Select the JAX-RS resource as a class when adding a procedure.

  The tutorial configuration is as follows:

  Note that the WoOF configured paths can be different to the JAX-RS end point mappings.  The only constraint on this is that the path parameters must match.



*Testing

  The following tests demonstrates the procedures.
