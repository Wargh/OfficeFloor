Migrate JAX-RS Tutorial

  This tutorial provides the typical steps in migrating a JAX-RS resource to avoid dependency on JAX-RS.  It also enables simpler code that can take advantage of all the OfficeFloor features.

*Steps to migrate a JAX-RS resource

  The JAX-RS resource to be migrated is taken from the {{{./index.html}previous tutorial}}:

%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/src/main/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/jaxrshttpserver/JaxRsResource.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  To migrate a JAX-RS resource:

   [[1]] Replace the JAX-RS parameter annotations with WoOF annotations.
   
     * @PathParam to {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/web/HttpPathParameter.html}@HttpPathParameter}}

     * @QueryParam to {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/web/HttpQueryParameter.html}@HttpQueryParameter}}

     * @HeaderParam to {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/web/HttpHeaderParameter.html}@HttpHeaderParameter}}

     * @CookieParam to {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/web/HttpCookieParameter.html}@HttpCookieParameter}}
     
   [[1]] Request body object's class to be annotated with {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/web/HttpObject.html}@HttpObject}}

   [[1]] Send response object to {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/web/ObjectResponse.html}ObjectResponse}} parameter rather than returning it.
   
     * Note that can also continue to return object.  This object is then used as a parameter to the next linked procedure.
   
   [[1]] Remove the remaining JAX-RS annotations.
         
   [[1]] Move dependencies to parameters of the method.

  The resulting migrated code is as follows:
