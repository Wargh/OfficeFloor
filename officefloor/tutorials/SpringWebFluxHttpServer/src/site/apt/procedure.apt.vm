Spring Web Flux Procedure Tutorial

  This tutorial demonstrates configuring a Spring Web Flux Controller as a procedure.

  Adding a Spring Web Flux Controller as a procedure, allows re-use of existing code. Ideally, over time, the Spring Web Flux Controllers are simplified to methods taking advantage of OfficeFloor's {{{https://sagenschneider.blogspot.com/2019/02/inversion-of-coupling-control.html}IoCC}}. However, Spring Web Flux Controllers are supported as procedures to avoid significant rewrites of application code.  This enables taking advantage of OfficeFloor's features with existing Spring code.

*Configuring Spring Web Flux Controller

  Please see the {{{./index.html}Spring Web Flux Controller Tutorial}} regarding configuring Spring Web Flux Controllers into WoOF.  The tutorial needs to be followed to also enable Spring Web Flux Controllers to be configured as procedures.



*Configuring as a Procedure

  Select the Spring Web Flux Controller as a class when adding a procedure.
  
  Note: the Controller must be on the application's Spring scan path.
  
  The tutorial configuration is as follows:
  
[./images/SpringWebFluxHttpServer-configuration.png] SpringWebFluxHttpServer configuration.

  Note that the WoOF configured paths can be different to the Spring Web Flux Controller request mappings.  The only constraint on this is that the path parameters must match.


*Testing

  The following tests demonstrates the procedures.

  The {{{./migrate.html}next tutorial}} covers migrating Spring Web Flux Controllers for simpler code and avoid the dependency on Spring.
