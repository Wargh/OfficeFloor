OfficeFloor - method inversion of control framework

Work is currently underway to develop OfficeFloor version 3.0.  This a major rewrite of OfficeFloor to include functional programming concepts (mixed in with its object oriented concepts).   This has seen significant performance improvements and clarity on mixing functional and object oriented concepts together. 

OfficeFloor 3.0 is licensed AGPL. However, once released a LGPL license will also be made available at a small cost (need the occasional coffee for the late nights toiling away).
